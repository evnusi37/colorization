We include demo usage as an iPython notebook, under [./demo/colorization_demo_v0.ipynb](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/demo/colorization_demo_v0.ipynb).

This demo code requires a working installation of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and basic Python libraries (numpy, pyplot, skimage, scipy). Please contact Richard Zhang at rich.zhang@eecs.berkeley.edu for any questions or comments.
