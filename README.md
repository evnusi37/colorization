This repo contains demo code to run the colorization model described in <br>
<b>Colorful Image Colorization</b> <br>
Richard Zhang, Phillip Isola, Alexei A. Efros <br>
In [arXiv, 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511) <br>

We include demo usage as an iPython notebook, under [./demo/colorization_demo_v0.ipynb](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/demo/colorization_demo_v0.ipynb). Clone the master branch of the respository using `git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/richzhang/colorization.git`, `cd` into the `demo` directory, run `ipython notebook` and open `colorization_demo_v0.ipynb` in your web browser.

This demo code requires a working installation of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and basic Python libraries (numpy, pyplot, skimage, scipy). Please contact Richard Zhang at rich.zhang@eecs.berkeley.edu for any questions or comments.
