We include demo usage as an iPython notebook, under [./demo/colorization_demo_v0.ipynb](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/demo/colorization_demo_v0.ipynb). Clone the master branch of the respository using `git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/richzhang/colorization.git`, `cd` into the `demo` directory, run `ipython notebook` and open `colorization_demo_v0.ipynb` in your web browser.

This demo code requires a working installation of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and basic Python libraries (numpy, pyplot, skimage, scipy). For guidelines and help with installation of Caffe, consult the [installation guide](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), [Caffe users group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/caffe-users), and [Caffe Github site](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe).

Please contact Richard Zhang at rich.zhang@eecs.berkeley.edu for any questions or comments. Should you find this model useful for your resesarch, please use this [bibtex](http://richzhang.github.io/index_files/bibtex_arxiv2016_colorization.txt) to cite.
